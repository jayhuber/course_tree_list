Readme file for the course-tree-access block
=============================================

A plugin for the learning management system moodle to provide individual 
course assortment for its users.

Description
-----------
This plugin addresses the navigation problem for users that are enrolled in a 
lot of courses on a moodle site.

The hierarchy expands to courses in progress, and will display based on admin 
settings to display active courses for x number of weeks before they start
and after they complete.

It builds a hierarchy collapsable/expandable menu based on the categories.
The menu was designed entirely with CSS, and works for all browsers except for IE 8 
and below.  In that instance, javascript is a necessary evil.

 
Code Location
-------------
You can always find the latest version at: https://github.com/jayhuber/course_tree_list

Changelog
---------
v2013090900:
- Fixed hardcoded string that should have been in language file.

v2013011600:
-Error with missing $ie variable causing other browsers beside Internet Explorer to display "undefined variable"
-This fix is credited to Aleksandra Ferenz - Thank You!
-Reversed the README list, so the recent change is at the top

v2013011101:
-Found has_config was set to false and should have been true.  Affecting Moodle 2.4 installs
-Added 2 weeks as default value in case the Moodle config values are missing.
-IE7 & 8 Fixes
-The Previous version did not fix the IE problem, as my test environment had jquery running
 causing selectivizr.js to work, which it will not with YUI.  Im not so good at YUI.  So,
 the IE8 detect also adds the script from Google for jquery so this fix will now work.
-Will need to revisit this fix in the future, but, it is good enough now.
